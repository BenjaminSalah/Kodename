# KodenameKodename is an feature-rich application developed by the Kodename team that aims to combine and improve upon the best features of Karel and Scratch for the purposes of teaching children in a fun and interactive manner the fundamentals of programming. This includes learning some pillars of programming such as modularity, reusability,and other skills that can be easily applied for any other programming languages they may encounter in the future. Kodename attempts bridge the application gaps present in Karel and Scratch by both avoiding the need to understand deep language syntax while still creating a programming vocabulary bears resemblance to other mainstream languages. Kodename uses the Karel programming language to teach the user programming and with a user interface, Kodename aims to eliminate the need for the user to focus on syntax.
